# CBF_Obstacle_Avoidance

### Discription
This collection of MATLAB scripts intends to study the performance of state-constrained controllers utilizing control barrier functions in the context of obstacle avoidance.

## Concept of Control Barrier Functions

We consider a linear plant with parametric uncertainties of the form:

$$\\begin{equation}
\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t)) + g(x) u(t)
\\end{equation}$$

where $x(t) \in \mathbf{R}^{n}$ is a measurable state vector and $u(t) \in \mathbf{R}^{m}$ is a control input vector. The control input is assumed to be magnitude limited by $\vert u_0 \vert$, which leads to the following closed set for the control input space

$$\\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U} = \begin{Bmatrix} u \in \mathbf{R}^{m} : - u_0 \geq u(t) \geq u_0 \end{Bmatrix}
\\end{equation}$$

The objective is to determine a $u(t)$ for \eqref{LinearPlantModel} such that the plant state $x(t)$ tracks a desired reference $x_d(t)$ and that for any initial condition $x_0 := x(t_0) \in S$, it is ensured that the plant state vector $x(t)$ stays within the safe set $S \in \mathbf{R}^n$ i.e. the control input ensures that there is a CBF with $h(x,u) \geq 0$ for $\forall t \geq 0$.

 A superlevel set $\mathcal{C} \in \mathbf{R}^n$, which we refer to as a safe set, is defined in the following form:
  
  $$\\begin{equation}
      \mathcal{C} = \begin{Bmatrix} x \in \mathbf{R}^n : h(x) \geq 0 \end{Bmatrix}
  \\end{equation}$$
  
with $h: \mathbf{R}^n \times \mathbf{R}^p \to \mathbf{R}$ being a  continuously differentiable function, called  control barrier function (CBF).

The CBF can ensure for the presented control affine system that for any initial condition $x_0 := x(t_0) \in \mathcal{C}$, that $x(t)$ stays within $\mathcal{C}$ for any $t$, if there exists an extended class $\mathcal{K}$ functions $\alpha$ such that for all $x \in Int(\mathcal{C})$

$$\\begin{equation}
    \sup_{u \in U} [L_f B(x) + L_g B(x) u  + \alpha(h(x))] \geq 0
\\end{equation}$$

Where $\alpha(h(x)$ often chosen to be

$$\\begin{equation}
    \alpha(h(x)) = \gamma h(x)
\\end{equation}$$

with $\gamma$ being $\gamma > 0$.

### Pointwise Controller and CBF-QP Safety Filter

A linear controller of the following form is defined:

$$\\begin{align}
u_d = K \tilde{x}
\\end{align}$$

with $K$ being Hurwitz and $\tilde{x} = x - x_d$. The linear controller is tuned regarding the desired control performance but cannot generate safe commands by itself. Therefore the following CLF-QP safety filter is used to adapt $u_d$ such that $x(t)$ stays within $\mathcal{C}$ for any $t$.

$$\\begin{align}
&\min_{u \in \mathcal{U}}
\begin{aligned}[t]
  &\|u - u_d\|_2
\end{aligned} \\
&\text{s.t.} \notag \\
& L_f h(x) + L_g h(x)u - \gamma h(x) \leq 0, \notag\\
& -u_0 \geq u \geq u_0, \notag
\\end{align}$$

After each simulation run, a plot with results is given out. An example of such a plot is given here:
